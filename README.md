NewRenameTool

This tool is intended to be use with multiple related files, e.g. chapters of a book or manga, so that they are a) named
consistently and can be sorted in a more useful way. Instead of 
so instead of 
Chapter 1 By Name, First Name
Chapter 10
Chapter 11, Book 1
Chapter 2 Book 2 Series xyz

They are .e.g. all named "Chapter [xxx] with leading zeroes, and no random information. Like this:

Chapter 001
Chapter 002
..
Chapter 010
..
Chapter 011
..
Chapter 123

So instead of being sorted wrong from a numerical point of view, due to 10 coming before 2 in alphabetical sorting,
and having to search the whole list for the correct chapter, they are sorted correctly for reading purposes.
